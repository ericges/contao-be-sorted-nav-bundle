# Contao Backend: Sorted Navigation Bundle

Add this to your contao project to have an alphabetically sorted backend navigation. This is useful if you have a lot of backend modules and want to find them quickly.

## Features

* Works by including a tiny JavaScript file that does the sorting.
* Adds an option to `tl_user` to sort the navigation sidebar. Enabled by default.

## Setup

> Requires Contao `>=4.8` and PHP `>=7.4`


Require this bundle in your `composer.json` and update your dependencies:
```bash
composer require ericges/contao-be-sorted-nav-bundle
```

There is no more to it.
