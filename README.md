# Contao Backend: Sorted Navigation Bundle

> Requires Contao >= 4.13 and PHP >= 7.2

Adds an option to `tl_user` to sort the navigation sidebar. Enabled by default.

Require this bundle in your `composer.json` and update your dependencies:
```bash
composer require ericges/contao-be-sorted-nav-bundle
```

There is no more to it.
